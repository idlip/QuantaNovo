#+title: QuantaNovo:  An Hybrid QC path finder for Denovo genome assembly.


Based on *QuASeR: Quantum Accelerated De-Novo DNA Sequence Reconstruction* (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249850)

Taking this proof of concept ahead, as quantum buzz has been rising thanks to chip makers promising with *big bold claims*
Like nvidia, google and recent microsoft.

Soon by few years +not decades+, we might see ready to use applicaiton of quantum for real world complex problems
Like understanding nature, climate, cryptography... and breaking many questions

--------

* Install
Suggested and easy way is to utilize =uv= (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) python package manager.
Install it via pip or distro package manager or [[https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation][refer]] here

The repo is equipped with Nix flake to have reproducible development environment and ensure package tests.

#+begin_src bash
  # cd <dir> # to wherever you prefer
  git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/idlip/QuASeR quaser
  cd quaser
  uv self update
  uv init .
  uv add dimod numpy matplotlib dwave-ocean-sdk basedpyright ruff
  # desc: ^quant ^maths ^plotting  ^dwave system     ^lsp    ^lint/format
#+end_src

You should be able to run python or call files like so
#+begin_src bash
  uv run python3 # for python IDLE
  uv run python3 assemble.py
#+end_src


* About

The related paper *Genome assembly using quantum and quantum-inspired annealing* (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-88321-5) although done separately without their interference.

This appraoch tries to solve the NP hard problem of assembly DNA reads (strings) using =TSP=, =hamiltonian= path via =QUBO= matrix and trying to solve the =ising= matrix.

The ising matrix provides the spin states to utilize it for hamiltonain energy calculation, thus further implementation to trace the path with minimal energy must be accounted.

Although the above method does have finicky problem such as =numpy= with more array size gets memory allocation error.

Yet this proof-of-concept is not yet standard to utilize it for genome assembly. This provides a state-of-art solution to enrich further enhancement and understanding


- The work so far depicts the =BQM= (binary Quadratic model) solution for the Ising Hamiltonian

- Note: Need to understand lot of physics to go ahead further
